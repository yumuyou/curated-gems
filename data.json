    "summary_en": "The controversy surrounding Jwong's Riyadh vlog highlights deeper concerns about Saudi Arabia's increasing influence in esports. While Jwong's video appears to be a simple travel vlog praising the food, the FGC community sees it as part of a broader pattern of Saudi Arabia's cultural and economic expansion into esports. The acquisition of Evo and other events has raised alarms about the commercialization of the fighting game scene. The strong reactions reflect not just disappointment with Jwong, but fear about the future of grassroots esports and the ethical implications of partnerships with countries with poor human rights records. This incident raises important questions about the intersection of sports, culture, and politics in the modern era.",
