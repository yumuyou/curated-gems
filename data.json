Swift’s transition into engagement — a symbol of stability and commitment — prompts fans to ask what comes next: will her songwriting shift again toward themes of lasting love, family, or perhaps even positivity rather than pain? The piece suggests that for many fans, the news is bittersweet — joyful but charged with nostalgia for previous eras of Swift’s music that were defined by longing, loss, and intensity.

He says that if you don’t need a lot of money, you can lean toward doing what you love. If you want to be very wealthy, doing what interests you can help you find unique startup ideas. To get clarity, try things early, learn how good you are, see what working on something is really like, and choose paths that preserve options in the future.

He argues that while ‘priggish’ moral enforcers have always existed, the form called political correctness arose in the humanities and social sciences during the 1980s, when student radicals became faculty, gained power, and institutionalized norms. After fading in the late 1990s, a second, more intense wave returned in the 2010s, amplified by social media, cancel culture, DEI bureaucracies, and a proliferation of new “‐isms.” Graham suggests that the core problem isn’t caring about justice but the performative, orthodoxy-enforcing way in which it is done. He warns that wokeness—with its rapid changes in rules and definitions, and its substitutes for genuine virtue—carries risks. To counteract it, he proposes resisting the creation of new forms of heresy, demanding burden of proof for claims of harm, treating wokeness analogously to religion (where strict orthodoxy by authority is discouraged), and preserving pluralism and free expression.",
